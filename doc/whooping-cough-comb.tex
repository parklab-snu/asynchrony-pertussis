\section*{Abstract}

Infectious disease outbreaks typically exhibit a large-scale, spatial synchrony, reflecting coupling through shared environmental forcing and human mobility.
During South Korea's unprecedented large pertussis outbreak in 2024---2025, however, asynchronous epidemic patterns were observed throughout the country:
some regions experienced two epidemic waves, while others regions experienced only the first or second wave.
Integrating high-resolution surveillance data from 252 municipalities and a simple transmission model, I show that heterogeneity in introduction timing and local susceptibility can drive such fine-scale asynchrony even when transmission is spatially homogeneous.
These results redefine epidemic synchrony as a condition contingent not only on shared transmission dynamics, but also on variation in initial epidemic conditions.

\section*{Introduction}

Spatiotemporal variation in epidemic dynamics offers a powerful means for understanding factors that determine the timing and magnitude of epidemic waves across populations \citep{pitzer2015environmental,dalziel2018urbanization,pons2018seasonality,baker2019epidemic}.
Ecological theory predicts that spatial coupling---via shared environmental forcing and human mobility---can synchronize epidemic dynamics between neighboring locations, where epidemic waves propagate through space \citep{hassell1991spatial,sherratt2001periodic,grenfell2001travelling}.
Consistent with this theory, large-scale spatial synchrony has been observed across diverse pathogens, including measles \citep{grenfell2001travelling}, dengue \citep{cummings2004travelling}, influenza \citep{viboud2006synchrony}, RSV \citep{baker2019epidemic}, and SARS-CoV-2 \citep{paton2022rapid}, highlighting the near-ubiquity of spatial coupling in shaping epidemic dynamics.
However, an exception to this pattern has been observed in pre-vaccination pertussis epidemics, which exhibited substantially weaker spatial correlation than measles epidemics reflecting a stronger sensitivity to stochasticity and transients \citep{rohani1999opposite}.

Pertussis is a vaccine preventable respiratory disease, caused by the bacterium \textit{Bordetella pertussis} \citep{kilgore2016pertussis}.
Following the introduction of DTwP (diphtheria, tetanus, and whole cell pertussis) vaccine in 1954 and DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) vaccine in 1989 in Korea, the number of pertussis cases in Korea decreased dramatically, with less than 10 cases reported in 1995 compared to $>10,000$ cases reported annually around 1955--1963 \citep{choe2012national}.
However, pertussis cases have resurged in Korea and many other countries despite high vaccine coverage, raising concerns about the possibility of vaccine waning \citep{cherry2005epidemiology,wendelboe2005duration,wearing2009estimating} and pathogen evolution \citep{mooi2001adaptation,barkoff2018surveillance,lesne2020acellular}.

Between 2024 and 2025, an unprecedented large pertussis outbreak occurred in Korea, resulting in more than 50,000 cases by early 2025 \citep{kim2025pertussis}.
This outbreak marked a dramatic increase in the disease compared to 292 cases reported in 2023 and 21 cases reported in 2022, despite high vaccine coverage (91.1\% of identified 2024 cases had a known vaccination history) \citep{kang2024pertussis,kim2025pertussis}.
A considerable spatiotemporal variation in disease burden has been observed during the outbreak, but we currently have limited understanding of the underlying spatiotemporal variation in epidemic dynamics \citep{kim2025pertussis}.
Interestingly, this outbreak exhibited a pronounced spatial asynchrony, which deviates from theoretical expectations based on spatial coupling, raising questions about mechanisms driving this fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity in pertussis epidemic (Figure 1).

To understand mechanisms driving the apparent spatial asynchrony during the large pertussis outbreak in Korea, I combine a detailed spatiotemporal surveillance data from 252 municipalities with mathematical modeling approaches.
I begin by showing that asynchrony in pertussis epidemics, captured by heterogeneous epidemic timing, is associated with differences in introduction delays.
In contrast, the analysis of effective reproduction number reveals synchrony in underlying transmission patterns, suggesting that spatial asynchrony can arise despite synchrony in transmission.
To test this hypothesis, I develop a spatiotemporal transmission model that allows for shared transmission term and variation in initial conditions and fit this model to observed data using Bayesian framework.
Overall, the paper offers insight into how differences in initial conditions (i.e., introduction delays and initial susceptibility) can drive fine-scale spatiotemporal asynchrony in population dynamics.

\subsection*{Asynchrony in pertussis epidemics associated with introduction delays}

First, I begin by characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the pertussis epidemic in Korea.
The outbreak consisted of two waves that peaked around late July and December 2024 (Figure 1A) and exhibited large spatial heterogeneity in timing (Figure 1B,C) and magnitude (Figure 1D).
For example, both Seoul, the capital city located in the northwest region, and Busan, the second most populated city located at the southeast end, experienced two waves, whereas Daegu, the fourth most populated city located $<100$km away from Busan, only experienced the second wave (Figure 1C; see Figure S1 for epidemic dynamics in other regions).

To further quantify spatial heterogeneity in pertussis waves across Korea, I calculate the center of gravity (Figure 1E), which represents the mean timing of cases \citep{pitzer2015environmental}.
Notably, I find a sharp contrast between early (orange) and late (light blue) waves between many neighboring municipalities (Figure 1E), suggesting spatial asynchrony in pertussis dynamics.
To systematically evaluate this apparent asynchrony, I estimate the spatial synchrony function, which captures changes in correlation in epidemic dynamics as a function of distance \citep{grenfell2001travelling}.
The spatial synchrony function confirms a sharp reduction in cross-correlation with distance (Figure 1F).
For example, within 100km of distance, the cross-correlation drops below 0.25.
By comparison, pertussis epidemics in the US maintained cross-correlations above 0.2 even at 1,000 km \citep{choisy2012changing}, highlighting the fine-scale asynchrony in pertussis epidemics in Korea.
Interestingly, the variation in the center of gravity significantly correlates with the introduction timing ($\rho=0.53$; 95\%CI: 0.44---0.62; Figure 1G), suggesting that differences in introduction timing may contribute to the apparent spatial asynchrony.

\subsection*{Synchrony in temporal changes in pertussis transmission}

}
\end{figure}

I then ask whether the observed epidemic asynchrony can be explained by the differences in transmission patterns.
To do so, I quantify the effective reproduction number $\mathcal R(t)$, which measures the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual \citep{wallinga2007generation,cori2013new}.
For this analysis, I focus on municipalities with more than 400 total cases reported because $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates can be unstable when the number of infections are low.

Notably, $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates appear to be largely homogeneous across different regions, despite the apparent heterogeneity in the observed epidemic dynamics (Figure 2A).
Comparisons of correlation coefficients in $\mathcal R(t)$ versus correlation coefficients in reported cases between all pairwise municipality combinations confirm this observation (Figure 2B).
In 830 out of 861 municipality combinations, correlation in $\mathcal R(t)$ is higher than correlation in cases.
This is reflected in the spatial synchrony function for $\mathcal R(t)$ (Figure 2C), where the mean cross-correlation for $\mathcal R(t)$ ($\rho=0.71$) is considerably higher than that for cases ($\rho=0.30$).

\end{figure}

To better understand factors driving changes in $\mathcal R(t)$, I perform a regression analysis using a generalized additive model with three covariates \citep{te2013driving,wood2017generalized,kissler2020projecting}: (1) a municipality-level fixed effect allowing each municipality to have its own intercept; (2) a cumulative-cases term capturing the effect of susceptible depletion; and (3) a single smooth term shared across municipalities, which allows for temporal changes in pertussis transmission over time, such as seasonal forcing.
First, the smooth term suggests a strong transmission reduction around August and February, which coincide with the timing of school breaks (Figure 2D).
Second, the model estimates a significant effect of effect of susceptible depletion (Figure 2D; $p<0.001$).
Notably, this simple regression model explains 84\% of variance in $\mathcal R(t)$, suggesting that the observed temporal fluctuations in transmission can be largely explained by school-related seasonality and the gradual depletion of susceptible individuals.
Taken together, the analysis of center of gravity and $\mathcal R(t)$ suggest that differences in introduction timing and susceptible host dynamics are likely main drivers for spatial asynchrony in pertussis epidemics in Korea, rather than variation in seasonal transmission patterns.

\subsection*{Mathematical modeling of fine-scale spatio-temporal pertussis epidemic}

To test whether variation in introduction timing and susceptible dynamics alone can explain the observed epidemic patterns, I extend a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model \citep{rohani2010contact} to jointly estimated a single, time-varying transmission term, which is shared across all regions.
I also allow spatial variation in initial susceptible $S(0)$ and infected $I(0)$ fraction as well as the reporting rate $\rho$.
Variation in $S(0)$ captures differences in population-level susceptibility, whereas variation in $I(0)$ effectively captures differences in introduction timing.
For this analysis, I also focus on municipalities with more than 400 total cases.
The model is fitted using a Bayesian inference software rstan \citep{carpenter2017stan}.

This simple transmission model that assume shared transmission rate can capture fine-scale spatiotemporal variation of pertussis outbreak in Korea (Figure 3A) with a median R squared value of 0.86 (95\% quantile: 0.71---0.91).
Furthermore, I find a near-perfect correlation between the predicted and observed center of gravity (Figure 3C).
So what factors determine the timing of epidemic, and therefore the center of gravity?
I address this question by simulating the model between April 2024 and April 2025 across plausible ranges of $S(0)$ and $I(0)$.

First, increasing $I(0)$ leads to an earlier epidemic because it permits earlier introduction of the infection to the population (Figure 3D).
This is consistent with the earlier observations (Figure 1F).
Similarly, increasing $S(0)$ also results in an earlier epidemic.
This is because high levels of susceptibility allows for a large first wave, which prevents the second wave through the overcompensatory susceptible depletion (Figure 3E).
Finally, I estimate that the large reduction in transmission around late July 2024 and late January 2025 allowed the occurrence of two distinct epidemic waves (Figure 3F).
this estimated timing of transmission reduction is consistent with estimates from the $\mathcal R(t)$ analysis and coincide with the timing of school holidays in Korea.

I validate the model by taking the estimated transmission term and fitting the remaining parameters (i.e., initial infected, initial susceptible, and reporting probability) to data from the remaining 210 municipalities with less than 400 total cases (Figure S2).
While model predictions appear consistent with the observed patterns (Figure S2A),
I estimate a lower value for the median R squared: 0.58 (95\% quantile: 0.04--0.87; Figure S2B).
Nonetheless, this analysis suggests that the majority of asynchrony in pertussis epidemics can be explained via the differences in introduction timing and initial susceptibility.

\section*{Discussion}

Understanding mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal variation in epidemic dynamics is a major aim for infectious disease dynamics and control 
\citep{pitzer2015environmental,dalziel2018urbanization,pons2018seasonality,baker2019epidemic,grenfell2001travelling,cummings2004travelling,viboud2006synchrony}.
The large pertussis outbreaks in Korea that occurred between 2024 and 2025 presents a unique perspective on a fine-scale spatiotemporal asynchrony heterogeneity in epidemic dynamics: 
some municipalities experienced two epidemic waves while other places experienced only the first or second without a clear patterns of synchrony.
I propose that this variation can be explained by the differences in introduction delays and initial susceptibility, where high levels of susceptibility can cause a large first wave and prevent the second wave through susceptible depletion.
Incorporating this idea into a simple transmission model by allowing for a joint estimation of a single transmission rate with variation in initial epidemic conditions confirms my hypothesis.
Together, these findings demonstrate that differences in initial epidemic conditions---rather than variation in transmission---can generate fine-scale asynchrony, offering a general framework for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of re-emerging infections.

Even though the model presented in this paper explains the observed dynamics reasonably well, there are several limitations to this work.
First, the model is purely deterministic and does not account for stochasticity, which is likely an important factor for characterizing the establishment of infections after the initial invasion and the subsequent dynamics, especially in small populations \citep{finkenstadt2002stochastic,lloyd2005superspreading,magpantay2016pertussis}.
Second, I estimated that a variation in susceptibility can explain the observed epidemic patterns, but I was unable to identify the mechanism that explains this variation.
For example, I hypothesized that past vaccine coverage would explain variation in susceptibility given the role of waning immunity in driving pertussis re-emergence \citep{wearing2009estimating,tan2015pertussis,domenech2018impact}, but I did not find a significant correlation (Figure S3).

Resulting parameter estimates must be interpreted with care as the model relies on several simplifying assumptions.
For example, I assumed the same values of basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0$ across all municipalities.
Therefore, any regional variation in $\mathcal R_0$, driven by differences in contact rates and age distributions would be captured in the estimate of the initial susceptible fraction.
In other words, the estimated susceptible fraction should be interpreted as the effective susceptibility that also captures behavioral and sociological factors, beyond immunological differences \citep{park2025interplay}.
I also did not consider an age structure in the model, but age-structured contact patterns play an important role in shaping pertussis transmission \citep{rohani2010contact}.
For example, \cite{cho2024pertussis} recently suggested transmission among elderly may contributed to the persistence of pertussis in Korea.
Despite these limitations, this work provides a quantitative foundation and empirical evidence for understanding epidemic asynchrony.

The continued emergence of new pathogens and re-emergence of vaccine preventable infections, such as pertussis, highlights the importance of identifying hotspots of future outbreaks and developing targeted intervention strategies \citep{heymann2001hot,naguib2020towards,nguyen2022enterovirus}.
The apparent asynchrony in pertussis epidemic in Korea, driven by the differences in introduction timing and population-level susceptibility, underlines the importance of detailed pathogen surveillance for early detection and strategic allocation of prevention and control resources.
Immunological surveillance platforms will be particularly useful for evaluating potential risk of pathogen re-emergence in the future \citep{mina2020global,nguyen2025dynamics}.
A detailed understanding of spatial variation in population-level immunity will be crucial for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of future outbreaks.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Data}

The weekly surveillance data on pertussis cases across 252 municipalities (1st week of 2024 to the 44th week of 2025) were obtained from a publicly available website, the Infectious Disease Portal, by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency \citep{kordata}.
Population size data as of September 2025 were obtained from publicly available website by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety \citep{kordata2}.
Vaccine coverage data were obtained from a publicly available website by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency \citep{kordata3}.
Longitude and latitude data for each municipality were obtained from a publicly available GitHub repository \citep{github1}.
Finally, shape files used for constructing maps were obtained from a publicly available website \citep{shape}.

\subsection*{Center of gravity}

I quantified the center of gravity to characterize variation in the mean timing of epidemic.
Typically, the center of gravity is calculated based on annual incidence for recurrent epidemics.
Since the paper focuses on analyzing a single outbreak, I used the entire time series of reported cases $C_t$ to computer the center of gravity for each municipality:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Center of gravity}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{\tsub{t}{max}} C_t \times t}{\sum_{t=1}^{\tsub{t}{max}} C_t}.
\end{equation}
I then calculated the correlation coefficient between the center of gravity and the timing of introduction, defined as the first week when the number of reported cases is greater than 1 in 100,000.

\subsection*{Spatial synchrony of reported cases}

I characterized the spatial synchrony of pertussis epidemic, which captures changes in pairwise correlation as a function of distance \citep{grenfell2001travelling}. 
I used logged values of reported cases between May 2024 and March 2025, excluding municipalities that had no reported cases ($n=250$).
Spatial synchrony was calculated using the \texttt{ncf} package in R \citep{ncf}.
I used 1,000 bootstraps to generate the median estimate and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals.

\subsection*{Effective reproduction number}

I calculated the effective reproduction number $\mathcal R(t)$ to characterize changes in pertussis transmission over time. 
First, I took the case time series $C_t$ and fitted a generalized additive model assuming a Poisson error to smooth the time series \citep{wood2017generalized}. 
Then, I estimated $\mathcal R(t)$ using the method of \citep{cori2013new}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal R(t) = \frac{i(t)}{\sum_{k=1}^n i(t-k) g(k)},
\end{equation}
where $i(t)$ is the smoothed incidence and $n$ is the maximum length of generation interval in weeks (assumed to be 5 weeks).
The generation-interval distribution $g(k)$ was assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 9.47 days and a standard deviation of 6.22 days based on the estimated serial-interval distribution during this outbreak \citep{cho2025transmission}.
The reproduction number estimates can be unrealistically high when the number of infections is close to zero. 
Therefore, I only used estimates between May 2024 and March 2025 throughout the paper.
I truncated all $\mathcal{R}(t)$ estimates exceeding 5 to a maximum value of 5.

First, I compared correlation coefficients between $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates and those between logged cases across all pairwise municipality combinations (Figure 2B in the main text).
For this analysis, I only used data from municipalities with more than 400 total cases.
Then, I compared the spatial synchrony for $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates and synchrony for logged cases (Figure 2C in the main text).
For this analysis, I used $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates from all municipalities without any exclusion.

Finally, I fitted a generalized additive model to logged values of $\mathcal R(t)$ to quantify the effect of susceptible depletion and temporal variation in intrinsic transmission \citep{te2013driving,wood2017generalized,kissler2020projecting}:
\begin{equation}
\log \left(\mathcal R_{t,m}\right) = \alpha_m + \beta d_{t,m} + s(t),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal R_{t,m}$ represents $\mathcal R(t)$ estimate at time $t$ in municipality $m$;
$\alpha_m$ represents the municipality-specific intercept term;
$\beta$ represents the effect of susceptible depletion;
$d_{t,m}$ represents the cumulative cases at time $t$ in municipality $m$;
and $s(t)$ represents the smooth term capturing temporal variation in transmission. 
For this analysis, I only used $\mathcal R(t)$ estimates from municipalities with more than 400 total cases.

\subsection*{Transmission model}

Finally, I fitted a simple transmission model using Bayesian inference to test whether variation in introduction timing and susceptible dynamics alone can explain the observed epidemic patterns.
Specifically, I extended the SEIR model, which is commonly used for pertussis transmission \citep{rohani2010contact}, to allow for a joint estimation of a single, time-varying transmission term that is shared across all regions and a separate estimation of initial conditions and reporting rates.
To do so, I first discretized the SEIR model following the approach of \cite{he2010plug}:
\begin{align}
\beta (t) &= \mathcal R_0 (1-\exp(-\gamma\Delta t)) \delta(t)\\
\textrm{FOI}(t) &= \frac{\beta (t) I_m(t-\Delta t)}{N_m}\\
\Delta S_m(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-\textrm{FOI}(t) \Delta t)\right] S_m(t-\Delta t)\\
\Delta E_m(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-\sigma \Delta t)\right] E_m(t-\Delta t)\\
\Delta I_m(t) &= \left[1- \exp(-\gamma \Delta t)\right] I_m(t-\Delta t)\\
S_m(t) &= S(t-\Delta t) -\Delta S_m(t)\\
E_m(t) &= E(t-\Delta t) -\Delta E_m(t) + \Delta S_m(t)\\
I_m(t) &= I(t-\Delta t) -\Delta I_m(t) + \Delta E_m(t)
\end{align}
where $S_m(t)$, $E_m(t)$, and $I_m(t)$ represent the number of susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals in municipality $m$ at time $t$, respectively;
$N_m$ represents the population size of municipality $m$;
$\Delta t$ represents the simulation time step, which assumed to be 1 week;
$\beta (t)$ represents the shared time-varying transmission rate;
$\mathcal R_0$ represents the shared basic reproduction number, assumed to equal 17 \citep{anderson1991infectious};
$\delta(t)$ represents the normalized time-varying transmission rate;
$\sigma$ represents the rate at which individuals develop infectiousness, which is assumed to be $\sigma=-\log(1-7/8)$ such that the mean latent period is 8 days;
and $\gamma$ represents the rate at which individuals recover, which is assumed to be $\sigma=-\log(1-7/15)$ such that the mean latent period is 15 days.

Here, I modeled changes in transmission using the $\delta(t)$ term, which is given a normal prior around 1:
\begin{equation}
\delta(t) \sim \mathrm{Normal}(1, 0.2).
\end{equation}
To allow for smooth variation in transmission, I also incorporated a random walk prior:
\begin{align}
\delta(t) &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\delta(t-\Delta t), \sigma_\delta),\\
\sigma_\delta &\sim \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 0.1),
\end{align}
where a half-normal prior on $\sigma_\delta$ constrains the smoothness of $\delta(t)$.

The municipality-specific observation process is modeled based on a Poisson distribution:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{cases}_{t,m} &\sim \mathrm{Poisson}(\rho_m \Delta S_m(t))\\
\rho_m &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 1)
\end{align}
where $\mathrm{cases}_{t,m}$ represents the reported cases at time $t$ in municipality $m$;
$\rho_m$ represents the municipality-specific reporting rate;
and $\Delta S_m(t)$ represents the expected number of new infections between time $t-\Delta t$ and $t$.

Finally, I estimated a municipality-specific initial conditions by imposing the following priors:
\begin{align}
s_m(0) &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 1),\\
i_m(0) &\sim \textrm{Half-Normal}(0, 0.001),
\end{align}
where $s_m(0)$ represents the initial fraction susceptible in municipality $m$, and $i_m(0)$ represents the initial fraction infected in municipality $m$.
Then, the initial conditions for the model is specified as follows:
\begin{align}
S_m(0) &= N_m s_m(0),\\
E_m(0) &= N_m i_m(0),\\
I_m(0) &= N_m i_m(0).
\end{align}
I simultaneously fitted this model time series data between May 2024 and March 2025 from all municipalities with more than 400 total cases (a total of 42 municipalities) using a Bayesian inference software rstan \citep{carpenter2017stan}.

To assess the model fit, I computed R squared values for each municipality. 
This is done by calculating the squared value of the correlation coefficient between logged values of the observed cases+1 and a posterior median of the logged predictions $\rho_m \Delta S_m(t)$.

Finally, I evaluated the impact of initial conditions on pertussis epidemic dynamics by varying $s(0)$ between $0.13$ and $0.23$ and $i(0)$ between $7\times 10^{-6}$ and $1.5\times 10^{-3}$.
For each simulation, I quantified the center of gravity.

\subsection*{Transmission model validation}

I validated the model by fitting the model to remaining municipalities (i.e., those with less than 400 total cases).
In doing so, I assumed that changes in transmission rate $\delta(t)$ is known and only estimate the initial conditions, $s_m(0)$ and $i_m(0)$, as well as the reporting rate $\rho$.
For this validation, I simply used the optimization function in rstan \citep{carpenter2017stan} rather than performing a full Bayesian inference.
Then, I computed R squared values for each municipality in the same way as before.

\subsection*{Relationshiip between estimated initial susceptible and vaccine coverage}

I assessed the relationship between estimated initial susceptible and vaccine coverage using linear regression.
Specifically, assuming that the waning of vaccinal immunity is the main cause for pertussis re-emergence, I compared DTaP (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine coverage for 3 years old as of 2015 and the estimated initial susceptible in each municipality and performed a linear regression.
I used vaccine coverage as of 2015 because this was the oldest data that were publicly available.
I considered using estimates from municipalities with $>400$ cases, since the parameter estimates are expected to be more reliable, but were unable to find any clear signature between vaccine coverage and estimated $s(0)$.
